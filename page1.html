	<h3><b>How Bitcoin Starts?</b></h3>
	<p align="center">Bitcoin started with an article. In 2009, a software developer named Satoshi
Nakamoto published an article through crypto mail and published open source software.
The system relies on the exchange of money between two people without any
intermediary to send and receive money independently from time and space anywhere in
the world. All the shopping information and the amount of bitcoin and bitcoin wallet
information is recorded in a blockchain structure. A bitcoin is simply an SHA-256 hash
(which is an extremely large number) in hexadecimal format. The system is a blockchain
system that keeps itself alive. Blockchain is the registry of the bitcoin world. Actual money
transfer and all other data are kept here. The Blockchain system does not require a center,
it is a system of self-running networks. Blockchain network operations verify and then save
it to the system and mirror it to the system. Blockchain is a distributed database system.
The system keeps its own copy of the wallet to verify its own amount of money. Every 6 to
7 hours a new blockchain book is added to the system and distributed to all networks. No
double spending is done on this count. The amounts in the calculations are arranged in a
complete and fair manner. The Blockchain system is always connected to certain rules. In
order to keep the system up-to-date it needs to be up-to-date. For this reason, if a bitcoin
purse is broken, BlockChain will not allow any problems by leaving this account out of the
system. Also the bitcoin system has built itself so that fake blockchains are never allowed.
the money on everyone's account is protected and the person who is trying to create a
fake chain never gets the real chain. Transactions between accounts are performed using
a Forth-like script language. A value must be written to do the transfer. A digital signature is
absolutely required for the sender to send a money. An account can send multiple funds to
a single account.</p>
