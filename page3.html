	<h1><b>To sum Up</b></h1>
	<p align="center">Bitcoin, on the other hand, makes the states harder. The biggest reason why states
	are suffering from bitcoin is probably not getting tax. Since it is not a third-party payment
	system and products are usually sold on the internet, it is impossible for states to take tax
	on this sale. When we make a shopping on the internet under normal conditions, there is a
	portion of the money we have paid in the payment system, which goes to the government,
	but in the world of bitcoin, the transaction is not realized as such and most people start to
	use this money. In contrast, Japan is trying to expand the use of bitcoin. It is expected that
	tourists will be encouraged in Bitcoin in Olympic games to be held in Tokyo in 2020. As a
	result, Japan has begun to use most cryptographic currencies, including bitcoin, in trade.
	Thus, various taxpayers can be obtained from Bitcoin. Instead of trying to remove an
	emerging currency from Japan, it's a logical move to take advantage of it and make a profit
	for it.
	Bitcoin emerged as a result of a necessity. Of course, as we have mentioned
	above, there are some bad things, but the world of the internet has always been rebellious
	and has rejected the systems that the states have imposed on them. It turned out to be the
	end of this revolt in Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto stated at the beginning of his article that he
	built this system due to insecurity. It's not just a rebellion. Behind this system is a great
	technology and reason. Keeping the wallet information of people who use the system and
	making instant money transfers between these wallets requires great technology and
	software. Moreover, since it does not have a state behind it like other currencies, doing this
	job is more difficult than others. Time will show if Bitcoin can get money in our wallets.</p>
