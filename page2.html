	<h1><b>Mining in Bitcoin</b></h1>
	<p align="center">Bitcoin itself creates different business areas and this is the most known bitcoin
	mining. In Bitcoin, generating money involves passing the code chain, the algorithm,
	solving the equation. Technically everyone can make money and be a bitcoin miner, so a
	computer is enough for that, but it is now an pointless effort. Bitcoin has a money limit of
	21 million and this limit can not be exceeded.</p>
	<h3><b>The Computationally-Difficult Problem</b></h3>
	<p align="center">
	Bitcoin mining a block is difficult because the SHA-256 hash of a block's header must be lower than or equal to the target in order for the block to be accepted by the network.

	This problem can be simplified for explanation purposes: The hash of a block must start with a certain number of zeros. The probability of calculating a hash that starts with many zeros is very low, therefore many attempts must be made. In order to generate a new hash each round, a nonce is incremented</p>
	<h3><b>The Block Reward</b></h3>
	<p align="center">The Bitcoin mining network difficulty is the measure of how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. It is recalculated every 2016 blocks to a value such that the previous 2016 blocks would have been generated in exactly two weeks had everyone been mining at this difficulty. This will yield, on average, one block every ten minutes.

	As more miners join, the rate of block creation will go up. As the rate of block generation goes up, the difficulty rises to compensate which will push the rate of block creation back down. Any blocks released by malicious miners that do not meet the required difficulty target will simply be rejected by everyone on the network and thus will be worthless.</p>
